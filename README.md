# Blink3

This repository contains my custom made, Blink3 application. Currently, the application only compiles through Terminal/Command Prompt. The app is in a very early stage of development.  

UPDATE: - Tkinter GUI functionality implemented, can choose any desired colour to use on the BlinkStick

Note: BlinkStick firmware will be required for this program to work, so please visit https://www.blinkstick.com to download relevant software before use. This program has been specifcally designed for Python3.
