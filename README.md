# BlinkStick-App
This repository contains my custom made BlinkStick client application. Currently, the application only compiles through Terminal/Command Prompt. The app is in a very early stage of development.

UPDATE:
- Now works with the BlinkStick module in the terminal/command prompt and flashes once a colour has been selected

Note: BlinkStick firmware will be required for this program to work, so please visit https://www.blinkstick.com to download relevant software before use.
